## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information

## My process

I have started with a Mobile first approach. I had some trouble with some responsiveness elements. I also had some issues with the image of the crew to make that flow correctly through the website. And it was also challenging to get the line correctly in the header.

### Built with

- Desktop-first workflow
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - Stylesheet language
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework

### What I learned

I have improved my responsive knowledge. I also have learned some new techniques to apply styles, for example the line in the header but also different hover effects.
